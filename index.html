                <p class="text-muted bg-white">I'm Maria. I am a mom of two. I have a husband who I think is the most amazing guy in the world.
                    I really got that lucky. He has been my rock throughout this process. I took all of my prereqs in
                    nursing. I stopped, had my son. By the time I thought about going back for nursing, a lot of my
                    prereqs expired. Plus I was not thrilled with the idea of 4 years of school, especially with having a
                    family. My husband always said, if he could go back to school it would be for computers. He being the guy who
                    started in nursing and ended with his major in dietetics. Now he sells insurance. He always says a degree
                    is just a piece of paper. I agree with that to some extent. I do wish earlier in life I had gone to school.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted bg-white">But I am grateful I skipped out of wracking up a ton of debt. I thought later in life I would possibly be going to
                    college with my kids. Then that thought terrified me. I decided to research the types of computer jobs.
                    Types of schooling for computers. Computer science degree's, basically anything under the sun with the
                    word computer in it. I stumbled onto coding. I was shocked finding out you didn't need a degree in
                     this field. Amazed at the salary of a web-developer. I tried a free coding Bootcamp online. I knew from there
                    that this was for me.</p>
